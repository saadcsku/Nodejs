Node js
==============
=> Runs in process
=> Single threaded 
=> no blocking i/o model
=> keep events in stack
=> Event thought its single threaded but its efficient
=> the events wil be executed one by one without waiting for any event to complete. This is done by call back function
=> In other language such as PHP they are multi threaded. They assign task to other threads



Functional Approach
==================
=> We distribute responsibilities to different functions such as error function to handle error and data function to read data.
